Fault Tolerance. In a single-machine system, a failure is almost always total- All components are affected and entire system may be broughtdown (e.g ., OS crash, disk failures). Partial failures are possible in distributed systems- When one component fails, it may affect some components,while leaving other components unaffected. Fault tolerance means that a system can provide its serviceseven in the presence of faults. Fault tolerance requires- preventing faults and failures from affecting other componentsof the system- automatically recovering from partial failures5
